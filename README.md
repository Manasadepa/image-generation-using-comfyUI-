AI-Generated Images using Stable Diffusion & ComfyUI

This repository contains a collection of AI-generated images created as part of my internship on Image Generation using Stable Diffusion & ComfyUI. The images showcase various cinematic and visually striking scenes generated using AI models.                                                                                                                                                 Technology Used

Stable Diffusion – AI model for text-to-image generation.

ComfyUI – A flexible and customizable interface for AI image generation.

Custom prompts – Carefully designed prompts to create high-quality, cinematic images.
